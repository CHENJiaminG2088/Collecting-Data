## Social phenomena in Kanye West’s lyrics and their impact on public thinking
**"I am just the espresso, I am just the shot in the morning to get you going, to make you believe that you can overcome that situation that you dealing with all the time."** This is what Kanyewst said in an interview. The rap star has never been afraid to express his political views, life reflections, and resistance to racial discrimination in his lyrics. For example, the song in his album 《The College Dropout》 analyzed the economic structure of oppressed communities in the United States[[see the analysis]](https://medium.com/kanye2020-alpha/kanye-west-s-first-two-tracks-interpreted-c978fc0e1998)) . And in terms of individualism, he explored the definition of personal success, righs, reputation, and the price behind it. [[see an analysis]](https://www.socratic-method.com/kanye-west/the-best-kanye-west-lyrics-about-social-commentary). So has he really succeeded in becoming the "espresso" of the masses? This is what I want to discuss.
